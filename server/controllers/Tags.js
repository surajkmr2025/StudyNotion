// ⚠️  THIS FILE IS SUPERSEDED — do not add logic here.
//
// Originally this file held a Tags system (create/read/update/delete tags).
// That system was never completed and the Tags model was removed.
//
// The "category" functionality that replaced it lives in:
//   → server/controllers/Category.js   (createCategory, showAllCategories, categoryPageDetails)
//   → server/routes/Course.js          (/createCategory, /showAllCategories, /getCategoryPageDetails)
//
// This file is intentionally empty. It is safe to delete if you no longer
// need this note as a reference.
